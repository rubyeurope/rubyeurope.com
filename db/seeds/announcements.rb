  description: "Hey there, Ruby friends! 👋<br>Did you know one of our key goals (what we call our “second pillar“) at Ruby Europe is to bring fresh talent into the Ruby world? Yep, we’re all about growing the community by teaching newcomers and convincing seasoned devs to dive into Ruby.<br>
How can we maintain a vibrant community without fresh talent?<br>
At EuRuKo (and later at Rails World, Friendly.rb, and NYC.rb), we shared some ideas. At first, we thought, “These are 2025 plans.”<br>
But why wait? We’re ready to kick things off now, see what’s possible, and we need YOU 🫵  to help make it happen.<br>
Here’s are those ideas where you can jump in:
• Empowering Rails Girls - helping Rails Girls to run more frequently ⭐
• Build connections between bootcamps like Le Wagon and local Ruby groups 🤝
• Build/Join our Ruby Europe Mentorship Program 📗
• Help launch the Ruby Europe Online Academy/Bootcamp 🚀<br>
We’ll be sharing more info about these projects soon. They may seem ambitious, but there are small initial steps that will make a big impact! <br>
Let’s get started together: tag us, message us, and most importantly - refer friends who would be perfect for these roles! 👆<br>
Let’s grow this community together!<br>

<h2 class='text-3xl text-red' id='lookback'>Highlights from Ruby Meetups</h1>
<img class='w-full' src='/news/first-ruby-europe-newsletter/ruby-europe-event-highlights.jpg'>
Over the past few months, we’ve organized, collaborated on, and joined some incredible meetups. Here's a highlight:<br>
<h3 class= 'news-paragraph'>🇺🇸 New York 🗽</h1>
What better place to see a vision come to life than the city where dreams take shape?<br>
We teamed up with NYC.rb and NYC on Rails, bringing together 30 passionate Ruby enthusiasts for an unforgettable evening. It was a night filled with knowledge-sharing, incredible energy, and a true sense of community. 🎉<br>
The connections made and the warmth of the Ruby spirit reminded us why we do this. 🤝<br>

<h3 class='news-paragraph'>🇵🇱 Warsaw 🧜‍️</h1>
Even with two out of three speakers dropping out just a day before, the event turned out to be a huge success!<br>
With 4 presentations and over 60 attendees, the Ruby + AI Meetup in Warsaw became an awesome space for exchanging ideas and showcasing how great things can be achieved by combining Ruby with AI. 🤖<br>
It also served as a catalyst for making new Ruby connections and enjoying quality time with like-minded professionals. The best proof of its success? The heartfelt messages from attendees and the one question everyone kept asking: When’s the next one? ❤️<br>

<h3 class='news-paragraph'>🇪🇸 Barcelona, Madrid and Valencia - the Spain Triangle Project.️</h1>
The Spain Triangle project was the vision brought to life - a mission to awaken and unite Ruby enthusiasts across Spain by reigniting three key communities: Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia.<br>
It’s safe to say that this project marked the beginning of a new era for the Spanish Ruby community. Despite having to postpone the Valencia.rb meetup due to devastating flooding, the Madrid and Barcelona events brought together around 100 attendees and incredible speakers.<br>
The Valencia.rb meetup finally took place on December 11th, and judging by the glowing feedback from attendees, it was worth the wait. 🤝<br>
We believe the Spain Triangle is the foundation for building a lasting and thriving Ruby community in Spain. We can’t wait to see what’s next! 🇪🇸<br>

<h3 class='news-paragraph'>🇵🇱 Kraków 🐉.️</h1>
We were invited to visit KRUG – and what a journey it’s been!<br>
After a long break, they restarted small: a casual meetup over tea, coffee, and beer. No presentations, no pressure – just a group of Ruby enthusiasts reconnecting. Fast forward to their 4th meetup, and KRUG has grown into a thriving community, hosting full-scale events while keeping that friendly, laid-back vibe. 🤜<br>
They’ve shown us how powerful starting small can be. KRUG sets an example we hope many inactive meetups will follow! If you want to reignite - that’s how you do it!<br>
Massive kudos to the KRUG team—you’re an inspiration! 🚀<br>

<h3 class='news-paragraph'>🇵🇱 Warsaw candlelit meetup 🎄.️</h1>
We were part of the most unique Ruby meetup ever!<br>
What was planned as a regular PLRUG with a Christmas afterparty took a surprising turn when the power went out—and stayed out. But that didn’t stop anyone.<br>
Not only did people show up, but the cozy, candlelit vibe made it one of the best meetups ever. Amazing people, real conversations, and a festive atmosphere turned the unexpected into something unforgettable. 🔥<br>

We’re spreading the Ruby Europe vision far and wide! 🌍 That’s why you’ll find us at some of the biggest Ruby events and conferences across the globe.<br>
At EuRuKo 2024 in Sarajevo – the largest Ruby conference in Europe – we officially introduced Ruby Europe to the world for the very first time!<br>
We crossed the Atlantic to RailsWorld 2024 in Toronto, where we shared our mission of reigniting Ruby communities with our Canadian friends.<br>
And we made our way to the United States to present Ruby Europe at RubyConf in Chicago –the longest-running conference for Ruby developers.<br>
Promoting Ruby Europe on a global stage has been an incredible way to attract and inspire Ruby enthusiasts. Many of them have even joined us as Ruby Europe Ambassadors, bringing our vision to their local communities. 🚀<br>

<h2 class='text-3xl text-red' id='spain-triangle'>Three fantastic talks from the Spain Triangle Project!</h1>
Spain triangle projects brought us many fantastic presentations.<br>
Here’s a sneak peek:<br>
📍In Barcelona, Genar Trias Ortiz took the stage to share an incredible journey.<br>
He revealed how Factorial scaled from just 30 developers to over 1,000 in only six years. What’s the secret? How do you avoid the chaos that usually comes with such rapid growth?<br>
Genar’s talk was all about scaling a Rails monolith for hundreds of developers – while keeping things clean and under control.<br>

</div>
📍In Madrid, Egor Iskrenkov tackled a problem we all know too well.<br>
Code reviews: the endless cycle of “you forgot to…” comments piling up. It’s tedious, time-consuming, and – let’s be honest – a bit draining. 😩<br>
But what if there was a way to automate those nitpicks? Spoiler alert: there is!<br>
Egor delivered a fantastic talk on streamlining code reviews and finally saying goodbye to those repetitive “you forgot to…” comments.<br>

📍In Barcelona, Roman Samoilov introduced us to something exciting.<br>
His talk, 'Modernising Ruby Systems with Rage', explored how this high-performance, Rails API-compatible framework can help optimize Ruby systems for better efficiency.<br>
